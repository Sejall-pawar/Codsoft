        <h5>ABOUT</h5>
        <p>To become a Web Developer, you should have an understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It's also recommended to learn about CSS and CSS frameworks. Developing these fundamental web development skills will give you the foundation and logic for communicating with programming languages.
        </p>
        <p>How can I start learning web development? Is it easy? And how can I keep up with the latest web designing technologies? These are the questions that appear in every beginner’s mind. There is also confusion between web designing and web development, but we’ll talk about web development. 

           <p> It totally depends on how much you are interested in and are serious about it. if you desperately wanted to learn then you can easily be an expert on it. There’s nothing like it’s so hard or something like it’s so difficult to design websites like we use or look around our day-to-day life. e.g: Facebook, Google, Amazon, Flipkart, Snapdeal, and many more. </p>
